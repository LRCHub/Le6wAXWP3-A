(G. Kralj, D. Kralj)
Paranoia may destroy the things in life you love
Is there some kind of situation going down
Sunday driver please retire from the road you're on
I there another way to travel
Everybody wants to hear his voice drown out the fear
Everybody loves to lie
Storyteller reconsider did you see him there
Or was it just his picture hanging on the wall
Politician refuse to listen to the truth you hear
Will another dollar help to set him free
Everybody wants to see their face on MTV
Everybody loves to lie
Until we all fall down
And then we'll finally figure it out
Sunday driver baby
Story tellere maybe
Paranoia may destroy the things in life that you love
But by now are gone -- gone gone gone
There's no other way
Everybody wants to find a place where they can hide
Everybody loves to lie
Until we all fall down
And then we'll finally figure it out
Try to let it all hang out
And then we'll finally figure it out
Figure it out
