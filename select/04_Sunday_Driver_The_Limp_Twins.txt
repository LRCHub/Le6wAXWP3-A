I see sunlight creeping in
Through a hole in the wall
I get a funny feeling
I should go outside

I can't stand to be
Cooped up indoors
Gonna get my car
Come 'round to yours

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

It's been some time
Since I've been shut out
On the road
With the blue skies in front of me
I can let the past turn me 'round

Let's get ourselves lost
In the midsummer haze
Down the cool country lanes
That meander for days

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

Love is electrified
Current creates motion

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

Glamour of countryside
Roads like the ocean

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride
